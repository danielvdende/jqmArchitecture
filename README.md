We are the jQuery Mobile group and present here all our findings about the software architecture of jQuery Mobile. 
The repository contains the following items:
* <a href="#contextview">ContextView.md</a>
* <a href="#diary">Diary.md</a>
* <a href="#metrics">Metrics.md</a>
* <a href="#pitch">PitchSlides.md</a>
* <a href="#readme">README.md</a>
* <a href="#sketches">Sketches.md</a>
* <a href="#stakeholders">Stakeholders.md</a>
* <a href="#team">Team.md</a>

We will briefly explain the content of each file.

## <a name="contextview">[Contextview.md](https://github.com/delftswa/ReportingRepo/blob/jquery-mobile-week4/jquery-mobile/ContextView.md)</a>

In this file we are going to create a context model using the approach mentioned by Rozanski & Woods. 
First it was the intention this file and model had to be made for week 4. 
But the assignment changed and this exercise was moved to week 5, so the content of this file is mostly definitions
from Rozanski & Woods, and some starting views about the context.

## <a name="diary">[Diary.md](https://github.com/delftswa/ReportingRepo/blob/jquery-mobile-week4/jquery-mobile/Diary.md)</a>

This file shows the weekly progress of the group. What is done by the group, what they did individually and what time they worked on it.

## <a name="metrics">[Metrics.md](https://github.com/delftswa/ReportingRepo/blob/jquery-mobile-week4/jquery-mobile/Metrics.md)</a>

In this document we describe the [Goal Question Metrics approach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQM) for jQuery Mobile. 
We used the GQM approach proposed by [Basili et al.](http://fub-taslim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/WEMSE/INSTICC_Conference_Latex/gqm.pdf). 

We formulated a goal, identified three questions with this goal and identified at least two metrics per question.
The goal we are working on in this file, is:

Goal | Description | 
--- | -----
Purpose: | To decrease
Issue: | the execution time (speed)
Object (product): | of jQuery Mobile
Viewpoint: | from the viewpoint of the (lead) developer(s)

_**To decrease the execution time (speed) of jQuery Mobile from the viewpoint of the (lead) developer(s).**_

## <a name="pitch">[PitchSlides.md](https://github.com/delftswa/ReportingRepo/blob/jquery-mobile-week4/jquery-mobile/PitchSlides.md)</a>
This file contains a link to the slides made with [prezi](http://www.prezi.com), for the intermediate pitch held on, Friday May 17th.

## <a name="readme">[README.md](https://github.com/delftswa/ReportingRepo/blob/jquery-mobile-week4/jquery-mobile/README.md)</a>
You're just reading this file now, so we do not really need to explain this. This file explains the content of the repository.

## <a name="sketches">[Sketches.md](https://github.com/delftswa/ReportingRepo/blob/jquery-mobile-week4/jquery-mobile/Sketches.md)</a>
This document contains the first week assignment. It contains 4 sketches of the design of jQuery Mobile, all viewed from a different approach.
The following 4 designs are discussed, (also discussed during a guest [lecture](https://github.com/delftswa/lectures/blob/master/02-vanDerHoekSketching.pdf) by Andre van der Hoek):

* Application Design
* Interaction Design
* Architectural Design
* Implementation Design

## <a name="stakeholders">[Stakeholders.md](https://github.com/delftswa/ReportingRepo/blob/jquery-mobile-week4/jquery-mobile/Stakeholders.md)</a>
In this document, a stakeholder analysis is done, based on the book, Rozanski & Woods.
It contains several stakeholder classes, including acquirers, developers, testers and users. Within those classes several people will be named, which are categorized in those classes.
Not all the classes contain 'members', this because these were not applicable for jQuery Mobile.

## <a name="team">[Team.md](https://github.com/delftswa/ReportingRepo/blob/jquery-mobile-week4/jquery-mobile/Team.md)</a>
This document contains information about the members within the IN4315 Software Architecture jQuery-mobile group.


## <a name="communication">Communication</a>
In this part we explain our way of communicating during the assignments. 

First we have an issue which is for [General chatter (incl random BS!)](https://github.com/delftswa/jquery-mobile/issues/3). If we find some interesting stuff like papers, or have some information we just want to share, this is the issue we use.

For each week we have at least 1 issue containing the assignment where we discuss the assignment and add our content before adding it to this repository:
* Week 2: [Sketching](https://github.com/delftswa/jquery-mobile/issues/1), [Assignment Week 2](https://github.com/delftswa/jquery-mobile/issues/6)
* Week 3: [Assignment Week 3](https://github.com/delftswa/jquery-mobile/issues/10)
* Week 4: [Assignment Week 4](https://github.com/delftswa/jquery-mobile/issues/12)
* Week 5: [Assignment Week 5](https://github.com/delftswa/jquery-mobile/issues/13)
 
We also created some summaries of chapters read, we put these also in an issue so everyone can read them.
[Summaries of Rozanski & Woods](https://github.com/delftswa/jquery-mobile/issues/9)

Furthermore there are some other issues, about a successdful build, about the diary and teamfile. [Click here for all the issues!](https://github.com/delftswa/jquery-mobile/issues?state=open)
